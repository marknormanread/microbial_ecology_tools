# microbial_ecology_tools
Supervised machine learning tools for application in biology and healthcare. Originally developed for microbial ecology, but is relevant to other systems also. Contains tools to handle compositional data (e.g. from sequencing).

This is currently a collection of tools I use a lot. I have not yet transformed it into a format for public consumption, but please feel free to use if it is useful to you.
